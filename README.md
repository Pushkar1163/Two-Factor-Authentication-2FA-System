# Two-Factor-Authentication-2FA-System
Description of the Project: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) System
This project is about creating a Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) system to enhance the security of web applications. Let me break it down in simple language:

What is Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)?
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is a security process where users must provide two different authentication factors to verify themselves:

Something you know: This is usually a password.
Something you have: This is usually a one-time code (OTP) sent to your email or phone.
In this project, we are implementing a 2FA system using Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP). This means that once a user logs in with their password, they will also need to enter a one-time code (OTP) that is sent to their email. The OTP changes every few seconds, making it much harder for attackers to steal your login credentials.

Project Overview:
User Registration: When a user registers for the application, they provide their username, password, and email address. A TOTP secret key is generated for that user, which will be used to generate OTPs later.

Send OTP via Email: Once the user enters their details, the system sends an OTP (a one-time code) to the user's email. This OTP is generated using the TOTP secret key. The user needs to check their email and enter the OTP on the website.

OTP Verification: When the user enters the OTP, the system checks if it matches the one generated by the TOTP. If it matches, the user is allowed access; otherwise, they are prompted to try again. This step ensures that even if someone has the password, they cannot log in without the correct OTP.

Motivation Behind the Project:
The main goal of this project is to increase security for users and protect sensitive information. Passwords alone are not enough because they can be guessed, stolen, or hacked. By using two factors (the password and the OTP), the security level is significantly improved.

This system is commonly used in many online applications like email services (e.g., Gmail), banking apps, and social media platforms to ensure that even if someone knows your password, they still cannot access your account without the second factor (the OTP).

Key Features:
User Registration: Users can register by providing their email and a password.
OTP Generation: Each user has a unique OTP generated based on a secret key.
OTP Validation: After entering the password, users must input the OTP sent to their email for successful login.
Why is This Important?
Security: It protects user accounts by adding an extra layer of security beyond just a password.
Real-world Use: Many popular applications, like Gmail, Facebook, and online banking, use 2FA to prevent unauthorized access.
Learning Opportunity: This project is a great way to learn about Flask (for web development), pyotp (for OTP generation), and email handling with SMTP, which are useful skills for building secure web applications.
